	/// <summary>
	/// A Bitcoin address is derived from an elliptic curve public key and a set of network parameters.
	/// It has several possible representations:<p>
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// <ol>
	/// <li>The raw public key bytes themselves.
	/// <li>RIPEMD160 hash of the public key bytes.
	/// <li>A base58 encoded "human form" that includes a version and check code, to guard against typos.
	/// </ol>
	/// 
	/// <para>The most common written form is the latter, and there may be several different types of address with the meaning
	/// determined by the version code.</para>
	/// 
	/// <para>One may question whether the base58 form is really an improvement over the hash160 form, given
	/// they are both very unfriendly for typists. More useful representations might include qrcodes
	/// and identicons.</para>
	/// 
	/// <para>Note that an address is specific to a network because the first byte is a discriminator value.</para>
